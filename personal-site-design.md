1.What is you site's primary purpose?
The primary purpose of my site is to better express myself using these tools I just learned, and to deliver the info precisely to the potential employers who I will encounter soon I guess?
2.Who is your target audience?
The potential employers,friends,cohorts,relatives. Especially women of new immigrant who play many roles(mother,daughter,wife,employee/employer,volunteer...) at this moment. I hope they could feel being understood and listened when they visit my website.
3.How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
They can send emails to me or post comments? I would like them to feel being understood and listened.
4.How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
Thinking this website may be my third babies (The first two are human beings),I will build a simple one first, then add things from time to time. May ask my friends of musician,writer to be the guests. Remember I am a day dreamer? Should draw a big blueprint first to meet that title, shouldn't I?
